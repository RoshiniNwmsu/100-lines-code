# Employee Management System (CSV Version)

This is a simple console-based Employee Management System built in C# that manages employee records using an in-memory list and persists data to a CSV file.

## Features

- Load employee data from a CSV file
- Display all employees
- Add new employees
- Find employee by ID
- Update employee details (name and salary)
- Remove employees by ID
- Save updated data back to the CSV file

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (Version 6.0 or later recommended)
- C# IDE or Text Editor (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider)

## How to Execute the Project After Cloning

1. Visit the GitHub repository: [100-lines-code](https://github.com/RoshiniNwmsu/100-lines-code)
2. Click on the green `Code` button and select `Download ZIP`
3. Extract the ZIP file on your local machine
4. Open the project folder in your C# IDE (Visual Studio or VS Code)
5. Locate the `employees.csv` file (already included in the project)
6. Build the project in your IDE
7. Run the project from your IDE

## Notes

- The `employees.csv` file is already included in the repository
- Make sure the `employees.csv` file is in the same directory as `Program.cs` or inside the executable output folder (e.g., `/bin/Debug/net6.0/`)
- Any changes made during execution (add, update, delete) will be saved back to `employees.csv` after selecting **Option 7 (Save and Exit)**
- If the CSV file is missing or invalid, the program will start with an empty employee list
